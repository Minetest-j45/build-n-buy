# Build'N'Buy
A game inspired by Minecraft Championship(MCC)'s Build Mart, where you have to replicate mini build and to get the materials for them, you have to go 'shopping'.<br>
Initially made for 2021 Minetest game jam.<br>

## Warnings
Dont build a mirror of the demo, build it as if you were moving it to the side.<br>
If you dont like the music, there is a mute button in minetest for a reason.<br>
You have the fly priveledge so it is easier for you to build, use it!<br>
If you accidentally misplace a block in the building area(the only location you can place blocks), click on the block and you will get it back in your inventory.<br>
Making more than one trip to the shop for a build is ok.<br>
